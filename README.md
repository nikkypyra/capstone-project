Pawlog is a family sharing app to organize the daily needs of your furry companions.üê± It was made with Create React App and a Firebase backend.

- Create individualized pet profiles including photos
- Assign each pet their own task list
- Designate tasks to members of your family
- Edit and delete pets and tasks as needed
- Search for tasks by date or person responsible
- Add family members to share your pets, grant them access to make changes, and keep your schedules up to date
- A secure login ensures your information will be private

Pawlog was developed as my capstone project during the final three weeks of the [neuefische Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de) in May, 2020.

When viewing this app, please switch your browser to iPhone 6/7/8 mode, as it was developed and optimized for mobile use.
