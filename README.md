Pawlog is an app to organize the daily needs of your furry companions.üê± It was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend. 

- Create individualized pet profiles including photos  
- Assign each pet their own task list  
- Edit and delete pets and tasks as needed  
- Search for tasks by date or person responsible  
- A secure login ensures your information will be private
 
 
Pawlog was developed as my capstone project during the final three weeks of the [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) Web Developer Bootcamp in May, 2020.
